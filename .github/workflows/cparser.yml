# To reduce the load we cancel any older runs of this workflow for the current
# PR. Such runs exist, if there were new pushes to the PR's branch without
# waiting for the workflow to finish. As a side effect, pushing new commits now
# becomes a convenient way to cancel all the older runs, e.g. if they are stuck
# and would only be stopped by the timeout eventually.
# For deployment to the master branch, the workflow will run on each push, no
# skipping or cancellation will happen. This works, becuase the concurrency
# group uses "github.run_id", which is a unique number for every workflow run
# within the whole repository.
# Note that "${{ <cond> && <ret_true> || <ret_false> }}" is the designated
# github expression to emualte a ternary operator, where <ret_true> must be
# somthing that does not evaluate to 'false' so <ret_false> is returned always.
